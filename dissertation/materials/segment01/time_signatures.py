    There are five "stages" or cycles of 16 measures at q=54. The duration of
    each stage is 16/1 (or 32/2, 64/4, etc.) Each stage is subdivided into 2, 3,
    4, 3, then 2 almost equal parts.

    stage 1 divisions: 33/4, 31/4
    stage 2 divisions: 22/4, 21/4, 21/4
    stage 3 divisions: 17/4, 16/4, 17,4, 15,4
    stage 4 divisions: 21/4, 21/4, 22/4
    stage 5 divisions: 31/4, 33/4

    Then, each stage subdivision is reconceived as a duration with a different
    (fractionally related) tempo.

    stage 1-1: 33/4     @ q=54 (1:1)
    stage 1-2: 93/8     @ q=81 (2:3)

    stage 2-1: 55/8     @ q=68 (4:5)
    stage 2-2: 21/4     @ q=54 (1:1)
    stage 2-3: 63/8     @ q=81 (2:3)

    stage 3-1: 85/16    @ q=68 (4:5)
    stage 3-2: 7/1      @ q=47 (8:7)
    stage 3-3: 51/8     @ q=81 (2:3)
    stage 3-4: 7/1      @ q=72 (3:4)

    stage 4-1: 21/4     @ q=54 (1:1)
    stage 4-2: 105/16   @ q=68 (4:5)
    stage 4-3: 33/8     @ q=81 (2:3)

    stage 5-1: 155/16   @ q=68 (4:5)
    stage 5-2: 33/4     @ q=54 (1:1)

    Each stage is then recursively subdivided using the same uneven bifurcation
    algorithm described above. The result is a list of time signatures.
